This is a simple number guessing game program in C where I learned variables, conditionals and loop.

1.0
Generate the random number and prompt user to enter the number. When user inter the number compare the input number with ramdomly generated numbers using if condition and give user the hints whether they entered the number higher or lower than the randomely generated number.


**Roadmap**
In future I will be modifying this and add more features like asking users where they want to continue to play or quit, error checking such as user only input numbers etc.
